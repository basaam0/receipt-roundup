  <h2>Welcome to Receipt Roundup</h2>
  <p>
    Receipts are all-around a hassle, especially for those who aren’t particularly organized. Consumers get one every
    time they make a purchase, and often times it is misplaced or destroyed shortly after. Storing physical copies of
    receipts for an entire year can become extremely cumbersome. Additionally, the process of searching through these
    receipts can be inefficient.

    This web app keeps track of receipts so you don’t have to. Simply upload pictures of your receipts, and find them
    instantly by searching for text.
